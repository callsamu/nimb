# NIMB

Toy web-browser in Nim, inspired by [browser.engineering](https://browser.engineering/). Still being worked on.

## Building and Running

Since it is written in Nim, you must have it installed, along with Nimble. It also depends on SDL2.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/callsamu/nimb.
cd nimb
nimble build
./nimb https://callsamu.neocities.org/
```
